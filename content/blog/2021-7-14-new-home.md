This is my first blog post since moving back to China. I meant to publish it earlier this month, but somehow the days slipped away every time I thought, “just a quick break first…”

Six months ago, I graduated from UM and became another brick in Beijing’s endless construction site of corporate life. I once swore I’d never return to the city where I spent four cramped years as an undergrad—but two and a half years later, here I am 😂. As far as work cities go, Beijing isn’t that bad: no more showering in “roast duck ovens,” and my commute is under an hour. I’ll take it.

I actually enjoy what I do—data visualization journalism. Writing isn’t my strongest suit, but the department focuses on data stories, so I went for it. I’d long admired this team’s work and arrived with naïve dreams of making a legendary first splash.

Half a year in, the initial thrill has worn off. My “white moonlight” dream job hasn’t turned into plain rice yet, but the shine only appears in rare highlight moments. Most of the time, work is filled with tedious, granular details. Forget about a “one-shot to fame”—just finding the opportunity for that “one shot,” let alone sharpening the skills to take it, is already a full-time challenge.

My dad always says the most important part of a job is the eight hours outside of work. Now I get it. For me, eight hours on the clock aren’t enough to turn a job into a career.

It might sound like I’m advocating hustle culture, but that’s not it. At work, I’m a tiny cog whose job is to quickly deliver stories and hook readers. My personal goal, though, is to create lasting, representative data visualizations. Both are worthwhile, but they demand different timelines—and with my current efficiency, there’s no way to do both in the same eight hours (sometimes even one is a stretch without overtime).

So I’ve realized I need to invest personal time too. That’s normal—if this is what I want to dedicate my life to, it requires more than punching the clock. If everyone could achieve greatness on just eight hours a day, “personal growth” would be as fake as those “everyone’s a winner” slogans in feel-good education.

But every evening, another thought pops up: “You’ve worked all day. Don’t you deserve to just lie down? One night off won’t hurt—watch a show, read a novel, start again tomorrow.” The temptation is real, especially when I’m stuck debugging code or struggling with a draft. That’s when the white flag is hardest to resist.

I suspect many people know this feeling: big dreams in our heads, tiny actions in real life. We picture our grand achievements so vividly that it lulls us into thinking we’ve got it all planned, when in reality time just slips away.

To raise fewer “white flags,” I’ve found two tricks:

1.	**Exercise**. Since I started working out regularly, I end my day less drained and have energy left to do more. My body feels better—no more stiff neck or aching back—which makes me less likely to sigh, sulk, and avoid extra effort. A healthy body really is the foundation of everything.

2.	**Read blogs by the masters**. It’s free motivation 😂. I love browsing the personal sites of Nadieh Bremer and Yihui Xie. They have this magic of “being themselves” even in the grind of everyday life. Whenever I hit a wall building my own website, I peek at their early posts and realize that even industry greats had their struggles. They simply kept going, and eventually the spotlight found them.

I don’t know when my own highlight moment will come, but I’ll keep working toward it. And if it feels too far off, I’ll let myself rest, binge a show, read a novel, and snack on duck heads (seriously, Liaojibbangbangji’s duck heads are amazing—and thank goodness for Meituan delivery!).
