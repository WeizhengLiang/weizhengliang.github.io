Yesterday, an urgent task landed on my desk: compiling nationwide data on medium- and high-risk COVID areas. There were over a hundred entries—definitely a job for automation, I thought. But the deadline was tight, and the national data source wasn’t open access. So, manual entry it was. My fingers went numb typing “Platinum Palace” this and “Windsor Castle” that—it was ridiculous but kind of funny.

By evening, the joke had worn off. The data updated—but in random order. Meaning even though only a few new high-risk areas were added, I had to re-count everything from scratch. By the end of the first pass my eyes were blurring, and to make matters worse, I missed one entry and had to start over. The second version was barely sent off before I started frantically searching for a way to access the raw data source.

First, I tried using Chrome’s ResourceSaver plugin to download the page. It worked… sort of. I only got the first page of data—no access to the original JSON.

Since the data was paginated (seven pages, each loading dynamically), every time I opened a new page, it fetched fresh JSON from the server. ResourceSaver only grabbed the first page. Maddening.

I finished writing the JavaScript logic for the chart anyway. It was simple enough: grab the data length from the first <p> tag, extract province names, count the medium-risk areas per province, and list them out. That part ran fine. But the data source problem remained, and even using Octoparse for web scraping hit the same wall. Likely some anti-scraping mechanism was blocking me—I could never get beyond the first page.

Annoyed or not, the job still had to get done. As a last resort, I tried brute force: copy the data straight from the webpage and paste it into Excel. To my surprise, it worked! The raw paste wasn’t clean, but after a quick cleanup, it was usable. Victory! At least I didn’t have to manually match entries one by one anymore.

Next Monday, I’ll hand this off to the interns. Hopefully, they can streamline the process further—or maybe even find a smarter solution. 🤞
