      From the Caveman Movement to the Great Hall of Fame, What Make Ice Sports Popular Worldwide

In the beginning, we originally planned to tell the history of the ice sports in the origin of the Winter Olympic movement section.

However, as more and more information was compiled, I found that stuffing down the more in-depth history in the form of the Winter Olympic Games mini-games might seem ponderous, not easy reading.

Therefore, I took out the history of the ice sports separately. The my colleagues and I worked together, expanded and produced "From the Caveman Movement to the Great Hall of Fame, What Make Ice Sports Popular Worldwide".

During the process, Yanjun and I chewed a lot of papers, lamenting the unparalleled beauty of St. Moritz. She even jokingly said that her wedding ceremony should be held in St. Moritz in the future

I also communicated with Bichi on how to combine his drawings and content, my expression was not in point, which caused him to make more efforts to split the PS layers

I studied with Xiaoyin on how to superimpose the snow depth on the China map, our ideal is to make a relief-like snow depth map of China. However, the dream is very abundant, the reality is very skeletal......

But before the end of this project, I encountered a very torturous bug, which was actually very simple, but at that time, I was alone in my hometown. No one can help me.

And I couldn't find the answer by Google. So in that case, I "shout a lot" to vent my anger. My mother thought I was under huge pressure at work and told me to quit and go home to rely on her, haha~

Want to see exactly how I was tortured, you can jump to here:
