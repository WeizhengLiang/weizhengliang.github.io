This book is a solid minimalist history of the internet, packed with accessible introductions that make it easy for outsiders like me to get into the topic. The author is a computer science student, yet his thinking is steeped in business strategy, making the read engaging. That said, as the book progresses, I start to feel his explanations lean too heavily on what I call the “genetic theory” of companies:

> “Once a company matures, it develops a fixed genetic code, making it almost impossible to succeed in new fields. A company that dominates one domain is so finely tuned to its market—its culture, management style, and business model—that those internal factors become deeply embedded. This is why transformation is so hard for big firms, and why so many global giants eventually fade. Think IBM exiting PCs, Apple’s walled-garden approach, Microsoft’s slow reaction to the internet, or Symbian’s fake openness.”

To me, this “genetic theory” feels like a lazy, almost fatalistic explanation—akin to saying the U.S. is stronger than China simply because it has a “democracy gene” that China lacks. I understand the author may have simplified for brevity, but I don’t buy it. The reality is closer to “what rises must eventually fall.” Every sunrise industry becomes a sunset one sooner or later; the internet just cycles faster. What takes other industries decades or centuries to fade can happen online in just a year or two—“Sir, the times have changed.”

Another issue with “genetic theory” is how much credit the author gives founders for shaping a company’s destiny. Sure, if you’re Steve Jobs or Bill Gates, you leave an imprint. But once a company goes public, few founders truly dictate its trajectory. 3M started in lumber—does its founder still define the company today? Leadership changes can and do turn companies around, which undermines this deterministic “DNA” argument. And if we must call it “genetics,” what exactly is flawed—the company’s genes, or the CEO’s?

Later, the book veers into excessive praise for Stanford University. Had I read this as a high schooler, I might have sworn to spend my life chasing a Stanford admission (not that I’d get in). Likewise, the author claims Finland’s free education system “guaranteed talent for Nokia,” a connection that feels tenuous at best. Free education doesn’t automatically equal top-tier corporate talent—it seems more like the author wanted to compliment Finland and bent logic to do so. Some arguments lack data and rigor; they read more like opinions than analysis. (You can even sense a political undertone—a trait perhaps common among intellectuals of that era.)

That said, this remains a good primer on the internet’s evolution—an easy, exciting read that gets you fired up early on. My disappointment lies in the author’s own commentary, not the facts he compiles. I still learned a lot and am grateful for that. Next, I’ll turn to A Century of Innovation: The 3M Story and Jack Welch’s Autobiography to see how legends truly rode the waves of change.

One part I particularly liked is John Sculley’s 70-20-10 Rule:

> “In most IT markets, there’s a dominant player holding 60–70% market share, a strong second player with 20–30%, and the rest are small shops fighting over the scraps.”

The example given is telling: in traditional oil markets, no single company holds more than ~10%. But in tech, a giant can command over half. Why? Traditional industries have low R&D costs but high manufacturing and marketing costs, making them vulnerable to geopolitics. Internet companies flip this: low production and distribution costs, high R&D costs. Once you make Windows 98, you can replicate it infinitely; once Google exists, anyone online can use it. Scale happens fast, and giants emerge.

Yet dominance comes with dependencies. Intel chips rely on Windows systems. Google’s browser triumph over Microsoft was backed by an alliance of smaller players. No single internet firm thrives entirely on its own (Apple once tried to own OS, software, and network—and failed).

Another concept I liked is Peter Norvig’s Law of Saturation:

> “Once a company’s market share surpasses 50%, it can never double again.”

Growth is explosive in IT, but dominance breeds stagnation unless you find new growth engines. Two paths exist:

- Expand the core: Microsoft Office, Google’s Android Alliance.

- Transform entirely: Usually fails, as internal forces resist change.

At the end of the day, every company is fighting for traffic in emerging markets. Traffic is finite. As markets saturate, companies must build new ones (think livestreaming a few years ago, short videos today). It’s a personal lesson too: irrelevance doesn’t happen overnight—the signs are always there. When traffic flows freely, grab it. Before it plateaus, plan your next leap. Don’t pivot impulsively; expand wisely.

Lastly, I appreciated the mention of the Newman-Humboldt educational model. Unlike Confucian “teach and enlighten” traditions, Humboldt emphasized vocational and skills-based education. University learning should be immediately useful, equipping graduates to deliver value on day one. Personally, that resonates: I aim to read job descriptions, identify missing skills, and learn with purpose so I can hit the ground running.

In sum, this book is a great entry-level read on the internet industry. It fires you up in the beginning, but most of its true value lies in borrowed wisdom from other “business sages.” I’m a bit let down by the author’s simplistic reasoning, yet grateful for what I learned.

Key takeaways (business insights quoted in the book)

- Moore’s Law (Gordon Moore) – Every 18 months, computing power doubles or costs halve. R&D must race ahead to meet future markets.

- Andy–Bill’s Law – “Bill Gates takes whatever Andy Grove gives.” Software upgrades force hardware upgrades, fueling Intel, HP, Dell alike.

- Anti-Moore’s Law (Eric Schmidt) – Selling the same hardware volume 18 months later earns you half the revenue, pushing relentless innovation.

- 70-20-10 Rule (John Sculley) – 60–70% share for the leader, 20–30% for #2, scraps for the rest; leaders set the rules.

- Norvig’s Law (Peter Norvig) – Once you surpass 50% market share, you can’t double it again. Expansion works better than transformation.

- Genetic Theory of Companies – A firm’s culture and processes become entrenched in maturity, making transformation hard (examples: IBM, Apple, Microsoft, Symbian). I remain unconvinced by this one.
