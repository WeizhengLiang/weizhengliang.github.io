You can't control the market. You can barely control yourself. Inner Investor is an interactive metaphor that exposes our cognitive biases in financial decision-making. This project blends behavioral economics research, satirical storytelling, and a dynamic emotion system to create an experience that's both educational and thought-provoking.

> "You can't control the market. You can barely control yourself." â€” Core principle of Inner Investor

## Core Features

### Emotion Card Trading System

Players invest using emotion cards like "Fear," "Excitement," and "Doubt." Each card secretly embodies a specific cognitive bias, only revealed at the end of the gameâ€”making hidden emotional influence on decisions both accessible and entertaining.

### Absurd & Humorous Investment Scenarios

From spicy milk tea to banana phones, the game's over-the-top scenarios let players experience the ridiculousness of the market in a playful, non-preachy way.

### "Inner Investor" Narrative Experience

Your "Inner Investor" is a cartoonish, expressive character who pops up with dramatic sound effects and speech bubbles whenever you make a decisionâ€”delivering witty commentary and turning your inner conflict into a comic dialogue with yourself.

</figure>

### Personalized Bias Report

At the end, you receive a humorous, data-driven summary of your investment biasesâ€”complete with stats and playful tagsâ€”to spark self-reflection.

## Design Insights

### Fun, Not Forced Learning

The game uses comedy and exaggeration to reveal cognitive biases, letting players discover irrational investment patterns through laughterâ€”not lectures.

  <figcaption class="blog-img-caption">"Players discover their blind spots while "laughing", not while being lectured."</figcaption>
</figure>

### Hidden Bias Mechanics

Cognitive biases are subtly embedded behind emotion cards, only revealed at the endâ€”so players absorb behavioral economics concepts through play, not dry definitions.

  <figcaption class="blog-img-caption">"The deeper the hidden bias, the greater the 'aha' moment."</figcaption>
</figure>

### Emotion & Data-Driven Self-Insight

By analyzing your emotional choices, finances, and "rationality" score, the game delivers a blend of humor and personal insight at the end.

## User Insights

> "This game made me realize how irrational I am with money, even though I always thought I was cool and logical." â€” Jason Luo

Players often shift from confidence in their decision-making to recognizing their own biases.

> "The way the visuals changed really showed me how my emotions color the same information." â€” Joshua Berley

The adaptive UI effectively communicates the impact of emotion on cognitionâ€”even when players aren't consciously aware.

> "What impressed me most is the game never judged my decisionsâ€”it let me discover for myself why I made them." â€” Mark Zhu

A non-judgmental reflection system encourages deeper self-analysis than traditional teaching methods.

> "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."

## Learning Outcomes

- Hands-on experience transforming behavioral finance theory into playable mechanics

- Systemic thinking in designing emotion-bias-action chains

- Communicating complex psychological concepts through humor and narrative

- Sharpened ability to identify cognitive biases through user testing

- Understanding how to unify system, art, and writing to express a theme

## Future Plans

### Expand as an 'Emotion Education Tool'

Grow Inner Investor into a tool for emotion recognition and behavioral reflectionâ€”useful for financial education, emotional literacy, or as a supplement to high school economics classes.

### Multiplayer Mode

Develop a multiplayer version to show how group psychology shapes individual decisions and market dynamicsâ€”simulating herd mentality and bubbles.

### Research Collaboration

Partner with behavioral economics researchers to use game data for real studiesâ€”gathering decision-making patterns through play.
