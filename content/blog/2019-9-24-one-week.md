This week I made some changes about my projects after the discussion with professor Cairo, Catherine Ma and Lenny. They gave me lots of useful advices. Talking with experts never hurts. I also send my project proposal to Chinese indigo fabric museum. Maybe I will make adjustment after the conversation with them. There are some key points in my project:

- Attract general audience at their first glance
When professor Cairo told me, “think about why we want to read your article”, I was lost in thought. Sure, few people will click to see if I put my title as “A History from Chinese Blue Fabric”.

The blue fabric is not a feature word. People who are not a big fan of fashion cloth might not read my article. So, my article needs to attract them. Luckily, indigo dye is mainly used for making jeans.

I grabbed my boyfriend to image various “oops” titles with me. We listed “something you don’t know about your jeans”, “maybe your grandma already wears ‘made-in-China’” … in the end, I decided to choose “A Story from Ancient Cloth in China”. professor likes it. Thanks, my daring:)

Secondly, I want my audience feel more familiar with indigo dye fabric. Even though it’s among the oldest dyes to be used for textile dyeing and printing, it’s also seen everywhere.

It’s popular in making jeans, bed sheets, curtains, and some decorations. I want my customers to select an answer for the question” There is something in common, could you find it?”.

Because I just want them feel more familiar with indigo dye fabric, all answers will be reacted with the animation of “Congratulation”. After that, they could read the history of indigo dye.

Determine the primary and secondary roles in a project
In the beginning, I want to use the data of the change of textile export as my main data. However, professor Lenny and Catherine both told me to contact indigo dye experts to get more specific information about indigo dye. I feel nervous when I need to talk to strangers, especially experts.

I mean, they are experts! I know they are nice persons. It’s a little potato’s nervous. Nevertheless, I have to talk to people, interview them if I have my way to my career as data-viz. so I emailed them and waited for their feedback.

Besides, Catherine also suggested I put the data of textile, export as background information. I did. Other things are not the main role in my project, except indigo dye. So, I should receive more data about it.

- Try something new to ease my audience

In China, social media (text app) like Weibo, has daily active user as nearly 40,000,000-50,000,000, while short video apps like Kuaishou, Tik Tok, their daily active user is nearly 200,000,000-300,000,000.

So, some people predict fewer users will read the text, but watch the short video in the future. I agree with that. Graphics and moving things can easily attract people. It’s genetic things.

In the past, if people were not sensitive to color, they would eat poisonous mushrooms. If people were not sensitive to moving things, they would be attacked by the prey. In this case, I add some gif and scroll-telling to push my audience to continue to read.

- Think about mobile version first

More and more people become “Mobile Zombie” nowadays. it’s not for our health. But this phenomenon should rise our attention when we need to design our project.

Professor Lenny told me he often begins coding in mobile version, the tablet version. That’s correct! And also, this method will give me more space when I finish the mobile version. It’s easier to convert it into a tablet version. I will do in the same way.
