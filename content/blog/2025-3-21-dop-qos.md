This was a high-priority, fast-turnaround project—delivered from initial vague requirements to final optimized deployment in just **three weeks**. The dashboard was designed for **field engineers and data analysts**, enabling them to monitor real-time and historical performance of “Greenwave” corridors (coordinated traffic signals) and prepare daily reports for leadership teams.

## Key Features

- Citywide Overview: Interactive map to quickly identify corridors with low speeds or high stop rates, with the ability to switch between current and historical data.

- Granular Analysis: On selecting a corridor (via map or list), users can view direction-based metrics (east-west, west-east) and time-segmented data (10, 30, or 60-minute intervals) for speed, stop rate, and traffic volume.

- Detailed Road Metrics: Drill down to individual intersections for precise performance indicators, enabling targeted signal timing adjustments.

- Data Export: One-click export of processed data tables for reporting and further analysis.
