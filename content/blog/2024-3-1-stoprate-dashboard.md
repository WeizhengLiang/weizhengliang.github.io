This project was designed for an **exhibition setting**, aimed at helping **non-technical visitors** intuitively understand the concept of “greenwave” traffic coordination and its strong correlation with stop rates. The interactive dashboard allows users to **manually adjust greenwave timing**, turning potential red lights into green ones for passing vehicles, thereby experiencing how traffic signal optimization improves flow efficiency.

## Design & Features

Left Panel – Time-Distance Diagram:

- Vertical axis: time

- Horizontal axis: distance

- Each intersection is represented by red (red light) and green (green light) bars, visualizing the **greenwave bandwidth**.

- A wider bandwidth indicates higher chances of continuous green lights, faster speeds, and lower stop rates.

Lower Section: Visual simulation of intersections, signal states, and moving vehicles, accompanied by **traffic flow distribution charts** and **turning ratios** for each intersection.

Right Panel:

- Top: Real-time stop rate by intersection and direction.

- Middle: Overall average speed.

- Bottom: Real-time speed per direction along the corridor.

## Technical Highlights

- Fully front-end solution: All computations, animations, and state changes run **client-side only**, with no backend or external API calls.

- Optimized for performance: Memory-safe implementation ensures smooth animations even under continuous user interaction.

- Interactive learning experience: Default configuration creates frequent stops (e.g., 4 red lights across 5 intersections). With careful adjustments, users can widen the greenwave bandwidth, reducing stops to just 1 and significantly improving simulated traffic flow.

This project combined **data visualization**, **interactive UI design**, and **real-time simulation logic** to deliver a **clear, engaging educational experience** within a tight 3-week development cycle.
