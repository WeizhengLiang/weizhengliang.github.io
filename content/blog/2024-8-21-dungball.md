### Player Comments

> "OMG SO FUN I LOVE IT"

> "Cool game, very fun. I really like your VFX; they add a lot of polish to the game. However, I encountered quite a few collision bugs when the player was in tight spaces, but it's a minor issue — I was able to get out of it. Overall, it's a good game"

> "It's fun. Very good dung Beetle simulator"

> "I like this funny idea and of course the gold opening screen. The game was very easy to win, but I played it a few times for fun. For me personally, there wasn't enough variety in the game mechanics, but anyway, good job!"

## Development Journey

### Game Jam Experience

When the theme "Tiny Creature" was announced, our team immediately began brainstorming ideas. After considering various concepts like microscopic medicine adventures and ant colonies, we settled on the dung beetle concept for its unique gameplay potential and humorous appeal. The initial 8 hours were crucial for establishing our vision and dividing responsibilities among team members.

#### Development Timeline

**First 24 Hours**

- Implemented basic player and camera controllers
- Created dung ball physics and collection mechanics
- Developed ground painting system for dung trails
- Added win/lose conditions and core gameplay loop

**24-48 Hours**

- Refined player controls and ball physics
- Implemented UI systems and menus
- Added coverage calculation and display
- Integrated footstep mechanics

**Final 24 Hours**

- Added visual effects and animations
- Implemented sound effects and feedback
- Bug fixing and performance optimization
- Final polish and submission preparation

### Playtesting and Iteration

During the game jam rating time, I actively collected player feedback and quickly iterated on the game design. One particularly valuable piece of feedback led to a significant improvement in the game's mechanics.

> **Player Suggestion**
>
> "Completely funny, if there is a mode that makes the ball roll more and more bigger, it will be interesting"

> **Implementation & Reply**
>
> "Thanks a ton for playing the game and dropping your feedback! 🙌 Just wanted to let you know that we added a new feature based on your idea! The ball now gets smaller as it rolls but grows bigger when the beetle collects dungpiles. It’s a bit of a twist, but we think it adds a fun challenge! 😄 Hope you get a chance to check it out, and we’d love to hear what you think of the update! Cheers"

## Game Flow and Key Code Snippets

This diagram illustrates the core gameplay loop of PolySpell, along with key code snippets:

<figure class="blog-img-container">
  <img src="/img/projects/dungball/link.png" class="blog-img" alt="img" loading="lazy" />
</figure>

## Key Code Snippets

Beetle Movement

```csharp
void UpdateMovement(Vector2 input) {
    // Calculate movement direction
    Vector2 direction = input.normalized;
    // Move beetle and attached dung ball
    transform.position += direction * speed * Time.deltaTime;
    dungBall.UpdatePosition(transform.position);
}
```

Dung Trail

```csharp
void LeaveDungTrail() {
    if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Space) && dungBall.size > minSize) {
        // Create dung trail based on ball size
        float radius = dungBall.size * trailMultiplier;
        PaintDungOnGround(transform.position, radius);
        // Reduce ball size
        dungBall.DecreaseSize(decreaseRate * Time.deltaTime);
    }
}
```

Coverage Check

```csharp
bool CheckWinCondition() {
    // Calculate current coverage percentage
    float coverage = GetDungCoverage();
    // Check if reached target coverage
    return coverage >= targetCoveragePercent;
}
```

## Key Algorithms

Dung Coverage

```csharp
float CalculateDungCoverage() {
    int totalPixels = groundTexture.width * groundTexture.height;
    int coveredPixels = 0;

    // Count pixels covered by dung
    Color[] pixels = groundTexture.GetPixels();
    foreach (Color pixel in pixels) {
        if (pixel.a > 0.5f) coveredPixels++;
    }

    return (float)coveredPixels / totalPixels * 100f;
}
```

Collision Detection

```csharp
void CheckFootstepCollision(Vector2 footPosition) {
    float distance = Vector2.Distance(transform.position, footPosition);
    if (distance < (dungBall.size + footSize) * 0.5f) {
        // Game over if stepped on
        GameManager.Instance.GameOver();
    }
}
```

## Learning Outcome

Deepened understanding of game physics, procedural generation, and the importance of iterative design based on player feedback

### Conclusion

Dungball Domination achieved remarkable success in the Ludum Dare 56 game jam, ranking in the top 16.8% overall and notably in the top 1.6% for Humor. The game successfully delivers:

- A complete and polished game created within the 72-hour time constraint
- Unique and entertaining gameplay mechanics that effectively utilize the "Tiny Creature" theme
- Engaging visual style with smooth animations and satisfying feedback
- High replay value through dynamic gameplay elements

### Reflection

Participating in Ludum Dare 56 was an intense and rewarding experience. Working under extreme time pressure taught valuable lessons about rapid prototyping, efficient decision-making, and team coordination. The project's success in the humor category validated our creative direction and demonstrated the importance of maintaining a clear vision even under tight deadlines.
