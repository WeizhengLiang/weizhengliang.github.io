This project involved the end-to-end design and development of a large-format, real-time dashboard for visualizing urban-scale traffic data. It was designed for display on a command center screen, enabling traffic operators and analysts to monitor the city’s transportation system at a glance.

The dashboard provides an overview of the most critical metrics, including:

- **Real-time congestion index**

- **Average vehicle speed**

- **Vehicles currently in transit**

- **Total traffic volume across the network**

These metrics are updated dynamically and visualized using clear, high-contrast charts, ensuring immediate readability in high-pressure operational environments.

One of the core features is the **Top 10 Congested Roads** list, which highlights traffic hotspots across the city in real time. This allows traffic managers to quickly identify and respond to emerging bottlenecks. Additionally, the dashboard tracks **real-time inbound and outbound flow trends**, visualized with animated line graphs and area charts that help reveal temporal traffic surges or declines.

Another important component is the **regional flow map**, which uses directional arrows and color-coded heatmaps to show how traffic is moving between different districts. This macro-level visualization supports broader traffic planning and zone-level management decisions.

Finally, the system features a **congestion alert panel** at the segment level (e.g., from Intersection A to Intersection B), enabling precise targeting of interventions. Each alert includes congestion severity, speed drops, and time of occurrence—critical for real-time traffic control.

From a UX perspective, the challenge was to balance visual clarity with information density. I designed modular panels that could be rearranged and resized depending on use case, and ensured responsive layout behavior for various screen resolutions. Typography and color coding followed accessibility best practices to support fast decision-making.

This project demonstrated the power of intuitive design in high-stakes data environments and strengthened my experience in building city-scale operational dashboards that bridge technical complexity with human-centered interfaces.
