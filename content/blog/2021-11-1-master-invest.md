This project originated from my first article after I came to Caixin, ["The secret of making money from fund management"](https://datanews.caixin.com/2021-03-03/101670174.html).

This is also the first topic that Mr. Geng asked me to do after I came to Caixin. Before that, I knew nothing about funds.

I had no choice. As a journalist, I couldn't stop doing it because I didn't have any understanding. However, even though I chewed a lot of research reports, the writing was still a mess (now I dare not even look back).

Notably, the interactive mini-game developed by Weimeng in the article [Can you make money, timing is most important](https://datanews.caixin.com/interactive/2021/iframe/fund/) is quite popular. We played it several times ourselves to see when we could make the most money by selling.

With the above mini-game as an opportunity, we then had the chance to make advanced fund mini-games. Wei Meng was in charge of planning and development, and I was in charge of data and design.

The data part was simple, we picked a few funds and downloaded their real data from iFind for the past few years. For the design, after collecting relevant elements, I settled on the following two.

- [Small animation: gift wrapping](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/26/13/15/261315be087ea3772ffca8b63fe64e76.gif)

- [UI component matching](https://showcase.overlay-tech.com/project/e7b3f4a2-df1f-4581-8e72-94ded7dda88b/components)

Inspired by the above elements, I quickly designed the flowchart of the game.

As my first long-term interactive project after graduation, I am satisfied with the design of [The Way to Be A Fund Master](https://datanews.caixin.com/interactive/2021/invest-game1/). The only thing is that I couldn't do the keyframe animation at this stage, the animation was done by Wei Meng. If it were me now, this small animation should be done quickly~
