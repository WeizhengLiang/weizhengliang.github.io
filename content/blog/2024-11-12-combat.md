My journey into combat system development began with an inspiring moment - watching the reveal of "Black Myth: WuKong". As a long-time fan of the WuKong character in Chinese traditional culture, seeing this beloved character brought to life in a AAA game sparked my curiosity about combat system development. This curiosity evolved into a dedicated learning project, laying the groundwork for potentially larger game development endeavors.

## Technical Implementation

### System Architecture

The combat system is built on four primary interconnected systems, each handling specific aspects of the gameplay experience:

<figure class="blog-img-container">
  <img src="/img/projects/combat/flow.png" class="blog-img-large" alt="img" loading="lazy" />
</figure>

#### Input System

Centralizes all input processing through the InputManager, which routes combat-specific inputs to the MeleeCombatInput component for specialized handling of attacks, combos, weapon toggles, and defensive actions.

#### Combat System

The core gameplay logic resides in the MeleeCombatSystem, working in conjunction with the WeaponManager for equipment states and the DamageHandler for combat calculations.

#### Animation System

Managed by the RPGCharacterController, this system handles all character animations and their associated events, ensuring smooth transitions between combat states and accurate hit detection.

#### UI System

The CombatUIManager provides real-time feedback through combat state displays, debugging tools, and NPC interaction interfaces.

### Sequence Diagrams

The following sequence diagrams illustrate the key interactions between system components during combat actions:

1. Attack Sequence
   Demonstrates the flow of an attack action from input to damage calculation and UI updates:

2. Weapon Switch Sequence
   Shows the process of switching weapons and updating related systems:

## Technical Challenges

### Animation-Driven Hit Detection

<div class="text-red-500 font-semibold text-lg">Problem</div>

Synchronizing hit detection with animation frames while maintaining performance.

<div class="text-green-500 font-semibold text-lg">Solution</div>

Developed an event-based hit detection system that:

- Uses animation events for precise timing
- Implements efficient collision detection
- Manages weapon trail effects
