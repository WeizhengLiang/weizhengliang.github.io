  ### Who I Am

  I’m Weizheng Liang — a game developer and software engineer passionate about creating gameplay systems, tools, and experiences that put players first.

  ### Technical & Creative Background

  I bring a unique blend of software engineering rigor and player-focused design. With a Master’s in Computer Science – Game Development from USC (in progress) and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Rutgers, I’ve built projects ranging from data-driven combat frameworks to physics-based gameplay systems, always prioritizing performance, clarity, and player joy.

  ### Professional Experience

  Professionally, I’ve worked as a gameplay programmer at studios(Zhanxun & Linglu) like Shanghai Bamboo Network Technology and Bilin Planet, implementing complex systems in Unity (C#), optimizing algorithms for FPS stability, and collaborating with cross-disciplinary teams to deliver polished, player-ready features.

  ### Design Philosophy

  Inspired by Riot Games’ commitment to player advocacy and community-driven development, I aim to build experiences that respect players’ time, celebrate their skill, and surprise them in meaningful ways. My work combines technical problem-solving — from spatial partitioning optimizations to editor tooling — with iterative playtesting and feedback-driven design.

  ### What I’m Doing

  I’m currently building a TFT-like, data-driven rotating mode auto chess sandbox using Unreal Engine and C++. This project focuses on modular gameplay systems, highly customizable rulesets, and flexible content pipelines — giving designers the freedom to create and players to experiment with unique game modes.

  ### Beyond Development

  When I’m not coding or prototyping, you’ll find me playtesting indie titles, exploring new rendering or AI techniques, or studying how game systems can shape player behavior for the better.
